# ECG Heartbeat Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Application of Transfer Learning for MI Classification

Deep Learning (DL) has recently become a research subject in a variety of fields, including healthcare, where timely identification of anomalies on an electrocardiogram (ECG) can be critical in patient monitoring. This technology has recently shown remarkable progress in a variety of tasks, and there are high hopes for its potential to transform clinical practice. Rather than studying and applying transferable information through tasks, most studies have focused on classifying a collection of conditions on a dataset annotated for that task. In this paper, we implement a model based on deep convolutional neural networks i.e. CNNNet which is able to accurately classify five different heartbeat arrhythmias as per the AAMI EC57 standards. Further, we proposed a method for transferring the knowledge acquired by the model in this task to myocardial infraction (MI) classification. 

## Instructions

The dataset i.e. input csv files should be present inside an input folder in the root path.
